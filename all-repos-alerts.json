              "help": "# Deserialization of user-controlled data\nDeserializing untrusted data using any deserialization framework that allows the construction of arbitrary serializable objects is easily exploitable and in many cases allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Even before a deserialized object is returned to the caller of a deserialization method a lot of code may have been executed, including static initializers, constructors, and finalizers. Automatic deserialization of fields means that an attacker may craft a nested combination of objects on which the executed initialization code may have unforeseen effects, such as the execution of arbitrary code.\n\nThere are many different serialization frameworks. This query currently supports Kryo, XmlDecoder, XStream, SnakeYaml, JYaml, JsonIO, YAMLBeans, HessianBurlap, Castor, Burlap, Jackson, Jabsorb, Jodd JSON, Flexjson, Gson, JMS, and Java IO serialization through `ObjectInputStream`/`ObjectOutputStream`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nAvoid deserialization of untrusted data if at all possible. If the architecture permits it then use other formats instead of serialized objects, for example JSON or XML. However, these formats should not be deserialized into complex objects because this provides further opportunities for attack. For example, XML-based deserialization attacks are possible through libraries such as XStream and XmlDecoder.\n\nAlternatively, a tightly controlled whitelist can limit the vulnerability of code, but be aware of the existence of so-called Bypass Gadgets, which can circumvent such protection measures.\n\nRecommendations specific to particular frameworks supported by this query:\n\n**FastJson** - `com.alibaba:fastjson`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: Partially\n* **Recommendation**: Call `com.alibaba.fastjson.parser.ParserConfig#setSafeMode` with the argument `true` before deserializing untrusted data.\n\n\n**FasterXML** - `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: Yes\n* **Recommendation**: Don't call `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper#enableDefaultTyping` and don't annotate any object fields with `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonTypeInfo` passing either the `CLASS` or `MINIMAL_CLASS` values to the annotation. Read [this guide](https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/jackson-2-10-safe-default-typing-2d018f0ce2ba).\n\n\n**Kryo** - `com.esotericsoftware:kryo` and `com.esotericsoftware:kryo5`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: Yes for `com.esotericsoftware:kryo5` and for `com.esotericsoftware:kryo` &gt;= v5.0.0\n* **Recommendation**: Don't call `com.esotericsoftware.kryo(5).Kryo#setRegistrationRequired` with the argument `false` on any `Kryo` instance that may deserialize untrusted data.\n\n\n**ObjectInputStream** - `Java Standard Library`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: No\n* **Recommendation**: Use a validating input stream, such as `org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream`.\n\n\n**SnakeYAML** - `org.yaml:snakeyaml`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: As of version 2.0.\n* **Recommendation**: For versions before 2.0, pass an instance of `org.yaml.snakeyaml.constructor.SafeConstructor` to `org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml`'s constructor before using it to deserialize untrusted data.\n\n\n**XML Decoder** - `Standard Java Library`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: No\n* **Recommendation**: Do not use with untrusted user input.\n\n\n**ObjectMesssage** - `Java EE/Jakarta EE`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: Depends on the JMS implementation.\n* **Recommendation**: Do not use with untrusted user input.\n\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example calls `readObject` directly on an `ObjectInputStream` that is constructed from untrusted data, and is therefore inherently unsafe.\n\n\n```java\npublic MyObject {\n  public int field;\n  MyObject(int field) {\n    this.field = field;\n  }\n}\n\npublic MyObject deserialize(Socket sock) {\n  try(ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(sock.getInputStream())) {\n    return (MyObject)in.readObject(); // BAD: in is from untrusted source\n  }\n}\n\n```\nRewriting the communication protocol to only rely on reading primitive types from the input stream removes the vulnerability.\n\n\n```java\npublic MyObject deserialize(Socket sock) {\n  try(DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(sock.getInputStream())) {\n    return new MyObject(in.readInt()); // GOOD: read only an int\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP vulnerability description: [Deserialization of untrusted data](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Deserialization_of_untrusted_data).\n* OWASP guidance on deserializing objects: [Deserialization Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Talks by Chris Frohoff &amp;

              "help": "# Disabled Spring CSRF protection\nCross-site request forgery (CSRF) is a type of vulnerability in which an attacker is able to force a user to carry out an action that the user did not intend.\n\nThe attacker tricks an authenticated user into submitting a request to the web application. Typically, this request will result in a state change on the server, such as changing the user's password. The request can be initiated when the user visits a site controlled by the attacker. If the web application relies only on cookies for authentication, or on other credentials that are automatically included in the request, then this request will appear as legitimate to the server.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nWhen you use Spring, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection is enabled by default. Spring's recommendation is to use CSRF protection for any request that could be processed by a browser client by normal users.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows the Spring Java configuration with CSRF protection disabled. This type of configuration should only be used if you are creating a service that is used only by non-browser clients.\n\n\n```java\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;\nimport org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;\nimport org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;\nimport org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;\n\n@EnableWebSecurity\n@Configuration\npublic class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {\n  @Override\n  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\n    http\n      .csrf(csrf ->\n        // BAD - CSRF protection shouldn't be disabled\n        csrf.disable() \n      );\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)).\n* Spring Security Reference: [ Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) ](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/exploits/csrf.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-352](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html).\n",

The parameter may include quote characters, allowing a malicious user to terminate the string literal into which the parameter is embedded and add arbitrary SQL code after it.\n\nInstead, the untrusted query parameter should be safely embedded using placeholder parameters:\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"database/sql\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc handlerGood(db *sql.DB, req *http.Request) {\n\tq := \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='?'

              "help": "# Polynomial regular expression used on uncontrolled data\nSome regular expressions take a long time to match certain input strings to the point where the time it takes to match a string of length *n* is proportional to *n<sup>k</sup>* or even *2<sup>n</sup>*. Such regular expressions can negatively affect performance, or even allow a malicious user to perform a Denial of Service (\"DoS\") attack by crafting an expensive input string for the regular expression to match.\n\nThe regular expression engines provided by many popular JavaScript platforms use backtracking non-deterministic finite automata to implement regular expression matching. While this approach is space-efficient and allows supporting advanced features like capture groups, it is not time-efficient in general. The worst-case time complexity of such an automaton can be polynomial or even exponential, meaning that for strings of a certain shape, increasing the input length by ten characters may make the automaton about 1000 times slower.\n\nTypically, a regular expression is affected by this problem if it contains a repetition of the form `r*` or `r+` where the sub-expression `r` is ambiguous in the sense that it can match some string in multiple ways. More information about the precise circumstances can be found in the references.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nModify the regular expression to remove the ambiguity, or ensure that the strings matched with the regular expression are short enough that the time-complexity does not matter.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider this use of a regular expression, which removes all leading and trailing whitespace in a string:\n\n```javascript\n\ntext.replace(/^\\s+|\\s+$/g, ''); // BAD\n```\nThe sub-expression `\"\\s+$\"` will match the whitespace characters in `text` from left to right, but it can start matching anywhere within a whitespace sequence. This is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a whitespace character. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each whitespace sequence once per whitespace character in the sequence.\n\nThis ultimately means that the time cost of trimming a string is quadratic in the length of the string. So a string like `\"a b\"` will take milliseconds to process, but a similar string with a million spaces instead of just one will take several minutes.\n\nAvoid this problem by rewriting the regular expression to not contain the ambiguity about when to start matching whitespace sequences. For instance, by using a negative look-behind (`/^\\s+|(?<!\\s)\\s+$/g`), or just by using the built-in trim method (`text.trim()`).\n\nNote that the sub-expression `\"^\\s+\"` is **not** problematic as the `^` anchor restricts when that sub-expression can start matching, and as the regular expression engine matches from left to right.\n\n\n## Example\nAs a similar, but slightly subtler problem, consider the regular expression that matches lines with numbers, possibly written using scientific notation:\n\n```javascript\n\n/^0\\.\\d+E?\\d+$/.test(str) // BAD\n```\nThe problem with this regular expression is in the sub-expression `\\d+E?\\d+` because the second `\\d+` can start matching digits anywhere after the first match of the first `\\d+` if there is no `E` in the input string.\n\nThis is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a digit. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each digit sequence once per digit in the sequence, again leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\nTo make the processing faster, the regular expression should be rewritten such that the two `\\d+` sub-expressions do not have overlapping matches: `^0\\.\\d+(E\\d+)?$`.\n\n\n## Example\nSometimes it is unclear how a regular expression can be rewritten to avoid the problem. In such cases, it often suffices to limit the length of the input string. For instance, the following regular expression is used to match numbers, and on some non-number inputs it can have quadratic time complexity:\n\n```javascript\n\n/^(\\+|-)?(\\d+|(\\d*\\.\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\d+)?$/.test(str) // BAD\n```\nIt is not immediately obvious how to rewrite this regular expression to avoid the problem. However, you can mitigate performance issues by limiting the length to 1000 characters, which will always finish in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n```javascript\n\nif (str.length > 1000) {\n    throw new Error(\"Input too long\");\n}\n\n/^(\\+|-)?(\\d+|(\\d*\\.\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\d+)?$/.test(str)\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).\n* James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: [Static Analysis for Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0849).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n",

              "help": "# Information exposure through a stack trace\nSoftware developers often add stack traces to error messages, as a debugging aid. Whenever that error message occurs for an end user, the developer can use the stack trace to help identify how to fix the problem. In particular, stack traces can tell the developer more about the sequence of events that led to a failure, as opposed to merely the final state of the software when the error occurred.\n\nUnfortunately, the same information can be useful to an attacker. The sequence of function names in a stack trace can reveal the structure of the application as well as any internal components it relies on. Furthermore, the error message at the top of a stack trace can include information such as server-side file names and SQL code that the application relies on, allowing an attacker to fine-tune a subsequent injection attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nSend the user a more generic error message that reveals less information. Either suppress the stack trace entirely, or log it only on the server.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an exception is caught and its stack trace is sent back to the remote user as part of the HTTP response. As such, the user is able to see a detailed stack trace, which may contain sensitive information.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http');\n\nhttp.createServer(function onRequest(req, res) {\n  var body;\n  try {\n    body = handleRequest(req);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    res.statusCode = 500;\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain\");\n    res.end(err.stack); // NOT OK\n    return;\n  }\n  res.statusCode = 200;\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Length\", body.length);\n  res.end(body);\n}).listen(3000);\n\n```\nInstead, the stack trace should be logged only on the server. That way, the developers can still access and use the error log, but remote users will not see the information:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http');\n\nhttp.createServer(function onRequest(req, res) {\n  var body;\n  try {\n    body = handleRequest(req);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    res.statusCode = 500;\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain\");\n    log(\"Exception occurred\", err.stack);\n    res.end(\"An exception occurred\"); // OK\n    return;\n  }\n  res.statusCode = 200;\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Length\", body.length);\n  res.end(body);\n}).listen(3000);\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Improper Error Handling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-209](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-497](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/497.html).\n",

              "help": "# Server-side request forgery\nDirectly incorporating user input in the URL of an outgoing HTTP request can enable a request forgery attack, in which the request is altered to target an unintended API endpoint or resource. If the server performing the request is connected to an internal network, this can give an attacker the means to bypass the network boundary and make requests against internal services. A forged request may perform an unintended action on behalf of the attacker, or cause information leak if redirected to an external server or if the request response is fed back to the user. It may also compromise the server making the request, if the request response is handled in an unsafe way.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nRestrict user inputs in the URL of an outgoing request, in particular:\n\n* Avoid user input in the hostname of the URL. Pick the hostname from an allow-list instead of constructing it directly from user input.\n* Take care when user input is part of the pathname of the URL. Restrict the input so that path traversal (\"`../`\") cannot be used to redirect the request to an unintended endpoint.\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used directly in the URL of a request without validating the input, which facilitates an SSRF attack. The request `http.get(...)` is vulnerable since attackers can choose the value of `target` to be anything they want. For instance, the attacker can choose `\"internal.example.com/#\"` as the target, causing the URL used in the request to be `\"https://internal.example.com/#.example.com/data\"`.\n\nA request to `https://internal.example.com` may be problematic if that server is not meant to be directly accessible from the attacker's machine.\n\n\n```javascript\nimport http from 'http';\n\nconst server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n    const target = new URL(req.url, \"http://example.com\").searchParams.get(\"target\");\n\n    // BAD: `target` is controlled by the attacker\n    http.get('https://' + target + \".example.com/data/\", res => {\n        // process request response ...\n    });\n\n});\n\n```\nOne way to remedy the problem is to use the user input to select a known fixed string before performing the request:\n\n\n```javascript\nimport http from 'http';\n\nconst server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n    const target = new URL(req.url, \"http://example.com\").searchParams.get(\"target\");\n\n    let subdomain;\n    if (target === 'EU') {\n        subdomain = \"europe\"\n    } else {\n        subdomain = \"world\"\n    }\n\n    // GOOD: `subdomain` is controlled by the server\n    http.get('https://' + subdomain + \".example.com/data/\", res => {\n        // process request response ...\n    });\n\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [SSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Server_Side_Request_Forgery)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-918](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html).\n",

              "help": "# Type confusion through parameter tampering\nSanitizing untrusted HTTP request parameters is a common technique for preventing injection attacks such as SQL injection or path traversal. This is sometimes done by checking if the request parameters contain blacklisted substrings.\n\nHowever, sanitizing request parameters assuming they have type `String` and using the builtin string methods such as `String.prototype.indexOf` is susceptible to type confusion attacks. In a type confusion attack, an attacker tampers with an HTTP request parameter such that it has a value of type `Array` instead of the expected type `String`. Furthermore, the content of the array has been crafted to bypass sanitizers by exploiting that some identically named methods of strings and arrays behave differently.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nCheck the runtime type of sanitizer inputs if the input type is user-controlled.\n\nAn even safer alternative is to design the application so that sanitization is not needed, for instance by using prepared statements for SQL queries.\n\n\n## Example\nFor example, Node.js server frameworks usually present request parameters as strings. But if an attacker sends multiple request parameters with the same name, then the request parameter is represented as an array instead.\n\nIn the following example, a sanitizer checks that a path does not contain the `\"..\"` string, which would allow an attacker to access content outside a user-accessible directory.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar app = require(\"express\")(),\n  path = require(\"path\");\n\napp.get(\"/user-files\", function(req, res) {\n  var file = req.param(\"file\");\n  if (file.indexOf(\"..\") !== -1) {\n    // BAD\n    // we forbid relative paths that contain ..\n    // as these could leave the public directory\n    res.status(400).send(\"Bad request\");\n  } else {\n    var absolute = path.resolve(\"/public/\" + file);\n    console.log(\"Sending file: %s\", absolute);\n    res.sendFile(absolute);\n  }\n});\n\n```\nAs written, this sanitizer is ineffective: an array like `[\"../\", \"/../secret.txt\"]` will bypass the sanitizer. The array does not contain `\"..\"` as an element, so the call to `indexOf` returns `-1` . This is problematic since the value of the `absolute` variable then ends up being `\"/secret.txt\"`. This happens since the concatenation of `\"/public/\"` and the array results in `\"/public/../,/../secret.txt\"`, which the `resolve`-call converts to `\"/secret.txt\"`.\n\nTo fix the sanitizer, check that the request parameter is a string, and not an array:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar app = require(\"express\")(),\n  path = require(\"path\");\n\napp.get(\"/user-files\", function(req, res) {\n  var file = req.param(\"file\");\n  if (typeof file !== 'string' || file.indexOf(\"..\") !== -1) {\n    // GOOD\n    // we forbid relative paths that contain ..\n    // as these could leave the public directory\n    res.status(400).send(\"Bad request\");\n  } else {\n    var absolute = path.resolve(\"/public/\" + file);\n    console.log(\"Sending file: %s\", absolute);\n    res.sendFile(absolute);\n  }\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Node.js API: [querystring](https://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-843](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/843.html).\n",

First, normalize the path using `path.resolve` or `fs.realpathSync` to remove any \"..\" segments. You should always normalize the file path since an unnormalized path that starts with the root folder can still be used to access files outside the root folder. Then, after you have normalized the path, check that the path starts with the root folder.\n\nIn the latter case, you can use a library like the `sanitize-filename` npm package to eliminate any special characters from the file path. Note that it is *not* sufficient to only remove \"../\" sequences: for example, applying this filter to \".../...//\" would still result in the string \"../\".\n\nFinally, the simplest (but most restrictive) option is to use an allow list of safe patterns and make sure that the user input matches one of these patterns.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the first (bad) example, the code reads the file name from an HTTP request, then accesses that file within a root folder.

This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nValidate user input before using it to construct a file path.\n\nThe validation method you should use depends on whether you want to allow the user to specify complex paths with multiple components that may span multiple folders, or only simple filenames without a path component.\n\nIn the former case, a common strategy is to make sure that the constructed file path is contained within a safe root folder. First, normalize the path using `path.resolve` or `fs.realpathSync` to remove any \"..\" segments. You should always normalize the file path since an unnormalized path that starts with the root folder can still be used to access files outside the root folder. Then, after you have normalized the path, check that the path starts with the root folder.\n\nIn the latter case, you can use a library like the `sanitize-filename` npm package to eliminate any special characters from the file path. Note that it is *not* sufficient to only remove \"../\" sequences: for example, applying this filter to \".../...//\" would still result in the string \"../\".\n\nFinally, the simplest (but most restrictive) option is to use an allow list of safe patterns and make sure that the user input matches one of these patterns.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the first (bad) example, the code reads the file name from an HTTP request, then accesses that file within a root folder. A malicious user could enter a file name containing \"../\" segments to navigate outside the root folder and access sensitive files.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs'),\n      http = require('http'),\n      url = require('url');\n\nconst ROOT = \"/var/www/\";\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  let filePath = url.parse(req.url, true).query.path;\n\n  // BAD: This function uses unsanitized input that can read any file on the file system.\n  res.write(fs.readFileSync(ROOT + filePath, 'utf8'));\n});\n```\nThe second (good) example shows how to avoid access to sensitive files by sanitizing the file path. First, the code resolves the file name relative to a root folder, normalizing the path and removing any \"../\" segments in the process. Then, the code calls `fs.realpathSync` to resolve any symbolic links in the path. Finally, the code checks that the normalized path starts with the path of the root folder, ensuring the file is contained within the root folder.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs'),\n      http = require('http'),\n      path = require('path'),\n      url = require('url');\n\nconst ROOT = \"/var/www/\";\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  let filePath = url.parse(req.url, true).query.path;\n\n  // GOOD: Verify that the file path is under the root directory\n  filePath = fs.realpathSync(path.resolve(ROOT, filePath));\n  if (!filePath.startsWith(ROOT)) {\n    res.statusCode = 403;\n    res.end();\n    return;\n  }\n  res.write(fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8'));\n});\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal).\n* npm: [sanitize-filename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-filename) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-36](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-73](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-99](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/99.html).\n",

              "help": "# Uncontrolled data used in path expression\nAccessing files using paths constructed from user-controlled data can allow an attacker to access unexpected resources. This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nValidate user input before using it to construct a file path.\n\nThe validation method you should use depends on whether you want to allow the user to specify complex paths with multiple components that may span multiple folders, or only simple filenames without a path component.\n\nIn the former case, a common strategy is to make sure that the constructed file path is contained within a safe root folder. First, normalize the path using `path.resolve` or `fs.realpathSync` to remove any \"..\" segments. You should always normalize the file path since an unnormalized path that starts with the root folder can still be used to access files outside the root folder. Then, after you have normalized the path, check that the path starts with the root folder.\n\nIn the latter case, you can use a library like the `sanitize-filename` npm package to eliminate any special characters from the file path. Note that it is *not* sufficient to only remove \"../\" sequences: for example, applying this filter to \".../...//\" would still result in the string \"../\".\n\nFinally, the simplest (but most restrictive) option is to use an allow list of safe patterns and make sure that the user input matches one of these patterns.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the first (bad) example, the code reads the file name from an HTTP request, then accesses that file within a root folder. A malicious user could enter a file name containing \"../\" segments to navigate outside the root folder and access sensitive files.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs'),\n      http = require('http'),\n      url = require('url');\n\nconst ROOT = \"/var/www/\";\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  let filePath = url.parse(req.url, true).query.path;\n\n  // BAD: This function uses unsanitized input that can read any file on the file system.\n  res.write(fs.readFileSync(ROOT + filePath, 'utf8'));\n});\n```\nThe second (good) example shows how to avoid access to sensitive files by sanitizing the file path. First, the code resolves the file name relative to a root folder, normalizing the path and removing any \"../\" segments in the process. Then, the code calls `fs.realpathSync` to resolve any symbolic links in the path. Finally, the code checks that the normalized path starts with the path of the root folder, ensuring the file is contained within the root folder.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs'),\n      http = require('http'),\n      path = require('path'),\n      url = require('url');\n\nconst ROOT = \"/var/www/\";\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  let filePath = url.parse(req.url, true).query.path;\n\n  // GOOD: Verify that the file path is under the root directory\n  filePath = fs.realpathSync(path.resolve(ROOT, filePath));\n  if (!filePath.startsWith(ROOT)) {\n    res.statusCode = 403;\n    res.end();\n    return;\n  }\n  res.write(fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8'));\n});\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal).\n* npm: [sanitize-filename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-filename) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-36](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-73](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-99](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/99.html).\n",

These entries include a file path for the entry, but these file paths are not restricted and may contain unexpected special elements such as the directory traversal element (`..`). If these file paths are used to create a filesystem path, then a file operation may happen in an unexpected location. This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\n\nFor example, if a zip file contains a file entry `..\\sneaky-file`, and the zip file is extracted to the directory `c:\\output`, then naively combining the paths would result in an output file path of `c:\\output\\..\\sneaky-file`, which would cause the file to be written to `c:\\sneaky-file`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that output paths constructed from zip archive entries are validated to prevent writing files to unexpected locations.\n\nThe recommended way of writing an output file from a zip archive entry is to check that `\"..\"` does not occur in the path.\n\n\n## Example\nIn this example an archive is extracted without validating file paths.

In these attacks, unsuspecting users can be redirected to a malicious site that looks very similar to the real site they intend to visit, but which is controlled by the attacker.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against untrusted URL redirection, it is advisable to avoid putting user input directly into a redirect URL. Instead, maintain a list of authorized redirects on the server; then choose from that list based on the user input provided.\n\nIf this is not possible, then the user input should be validated in some other way, for example, by verifying that the target URL is on the same host as the current page.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used directly in a URL redirect without validating the input, which facilitates phishing attacks:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\napp.get(\"/redirect\", function (req, res) {\n  // BAD: a request parameter is incorporated without validation into a URL redirect\n  res.redirect(req.query[\"target\"]);\n});\n\n```\nOne way to remedy the problem is to validate the user input against a known fixed string before doing the redirection:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\nconst VALID_REDIRECT = \"http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html\";\n\napp.get(\"/redirect\", function (req, res) {\n  // GOOD: the request parameter is validated against a known fixed string\n  let target = req.query[\"target\"];\n  if (VALID_REDIRECT === target) {\n    res.redirect(target);\n  } else {\n    res.redirect(\"/\");\n  }\n});\n\n```\nAlternatively, we can check that the target URL does not redirect to a different host by parsing it relative to a base URL with a known host and verifying that the host stays the same:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\nfunction isLocalUrl(path) {\n  try {\n    return (\n      // TODO: consider substituting your own domain for example.com\n      new URL(path, \"https://example.com\").origin === \"https://example.com\"\n    );\n  } catch (e) {\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n\napp.get(\"/redirect\", function (req, res) {\n  // GOOD: check that we don't redirect to a different host\n  let target = req.query[\"target\"];\n  if (isLocalUrl(target)) {\n    res.redirect(target);\n  } else {\n    res.redirect(\"/\");\n  }\n});\n\n```\nNote that as written, the above code will allow redirects to URLs on `example.com`, which is harmless but perhaps not intended. You can substitute your own domain (if known) for `example.com` to prevent this.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [ XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-601](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html).\n",

              "help": "# Incomplete URL substring sanitization\nSanitizing untrusted URLs is an important technique for preventing attacks such as request forgeries and malicious redirections. Usually, this is done by checking that the host of a URL is in a set of allowed hosts.\n\nHowever, treating the URL as a string and checking if one of the allowed hosts is a substring of the URL is very prone to errors. Malicious URLs can bypass such security checks by embedding one of the allowed hosts in an unexpected location.\n\nEven if the substring check is not used in a security-critical context, the incomplete check may still cause undesirable behaviors when the check succeeds accidentally.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nParse a URL before performing a check on its host value, and ensure that the check handles arbitrary subdomain sequences correctly.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example code checks that a URL redirection will reach the `example.com` domain, or one of its subdomains, and not some malicious site.\n\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/some/path', function(req, res) {\n    let url = req.param(\"url\");\n    // BAD: the host of `url` may be controlled by an attacker\n    if (url.includes(\"example.com\")) {\n        res.redirect(url);\n    }\n});\n\n```\nThe substring check is, however, easy to bypass. For example by embedding `example.com` in the path component: `http://evil-example.net/example.com`, or in the query string component: `http://evil-example.net/?x=example.com`. Address these shortcomings by checking the host of the parsed URL instead:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/some/path', function(req, res) {\n    let url = req.param(\"url\"),\n        host = urlLib.parse(url).host;\n    // BAD: the host of `url` may be controlled by an attacker\n    if (host.includes(\"example.com\")) {\n        res.redirect(url);\n    }\n});\n\n```\nThis is still not a sufficient check as the following URLs bypass it: `http://evil-example.com` `http://example.com.evil-example.net`. Instead, use an explicit whitelist of allowed hosts to make the redirect secure:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/some/path', function(req, res) {\n    let url = req.param('url'),\n        host = urlLib.parse(url).host;\n    // GOOD: the host of `url` can not be controlled by an attacker\n    let allowedHosts = [\n        'example.com',\n        'beta.example.com',\n        'www.example.com'\n    ];\n    if (allowedHosts.includes(host)) {\n        res.redirect(url);\n    }\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [SSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Server_Side_Request_Forgery)\n* OWASP: [XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n",

              "help": "# Incomplete URL substring sanitization\nSanitizing untrusted URLs is an important technique for preventing attacks such as request forgeries and malicious redirections. Usually, this is done by checking that the host of a URL is in a set of allowed hosts.\n\nHowever, treating the URL as a string and checking if one of the allowed hosts is a substring of the URL is very prone to errors. Malicious URLs can bypass such security checks by embedding one of the allowed hosts in an unexpected location.\n\nEven if the substring check is not used in a security-critical context, the incomplete check may still cause undesirable behaviors when the check succeeds accidentally.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nParse a URL before performing a check on its host value, and ensure that the check handles arbitrary subdomain sequences correctly.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example code checks that a URL redirection will reach the `example.com` domain, or one of its subdomains, and not some malicious site.\n\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/some/path', function(req, res) {\n    let url = req.param(\"url\");\n    // BAD: the host of `url` may be controlled by an attacker\n    if (url.includes(\"example.com\")) {\n        res.redirect(url);\n    }\n});\n\n```\nThe substring check is, however, easy to bypass. For example by embedding `example.com` in the path component: `http://evil-example.net/example.com`, or in the query string component: `http://evil-example.net/?x=example.com`. Address these shortcomings by checking the host of the parsed URL instead:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/some/path', function(req, res) {\n    let url = req.param(\"url\"),\n        host = urlLib.parse(url).host;\n    // BAD: the host of `url` may be controlled by an attacker\n    if (host.includes(\"example.com\")) {\n        res.redirect(url);\n    }\n});\n\n```\nThis is still not a sufficient check as the following URLs bypass it: `http://evil-example.com` `http://example.com.evil-example.net`. Instead, use an explicit whitelist of allowed hosts to make the redirect secure:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/some/path', function(req, res) {\n    let url = req.param('url'),\n        host = urlLib.parse(url).host;\n    // GOOD: the host of `url` can not be controlled by an attacker\n    let allowedHosts = [\n        'example.com',\n        'beta.example.com',\n        'www.example.com'\n    ];\n    if (allowedHosts.includes(host)) {\n        res.redirect(url);\n    }\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [SSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Server_Side_Request_Forgery)\n* OWASP: [XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n",

              "summary": "urllib3 redirects are not disabled when retries are disabled on PoolManager instantiation",
              "description": "urllib3 handles redirects and retries using the same mechanism, which is controlled by the `Retry` object. The most common way to disable redirects is at the request level, as follows:\n\n```python\nresp = urllib3.request(\"GET\", \"https://httpbin.org/redirect/1\", redirect=False)\nprint(resp.status)\n# 302\n```\n\nHowever, it is also possible to disable redirects, for all requests, by instantiating a `PoolManager` and specifying `retries` in a way that disable redirects:\n\n```python\nimport urllib3\n\nhttp = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=0)  # should raise MaxRetryError on redirect\nhttp = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=urllib3.Retry(redirect=0))  # equivalent to the above\nhttp = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=False)  # should return the first response\n\nresp = http.request(\"GET\", \"https://httpbin.org/redirect/1\")\n```\n\nHowever, the `retries` parameter is currently ignored, which means all the above examples don't disable redirects.\n\n## Affected usages\n\nPassing `retries` on `PoolManager` instantiation to disable redirects or restrict their number.\n\nBy default, requests and botocore users are not affected.\n\n## Impact\n\nRedirects are often used to exploit SSRF vulnerabilities. An application attempting to mitigate SSRF or open redirect vulnerabilities by disabling redirects at the PoolManager level will remain vulnerable.\n\n## Remediation\n\nYou can remediate this vulnerability with the following steps:\n\n * Upgrade to a patched version of urllib3. If your organization would benefit from the continued support of urllib3 1.x, please contact [sethmichaellarson@gmail.com](mailto:sethmichaellarson@gmail.com) to discuss sponsorship or contribution opportunities.\n * Disable redirects at the `request()` level instead of the `PoolManager()` level.",

              "description": "When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected.\n\nHowever, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects.\n\nBecause this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident.\n\nUsers should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach.\n\n## Affected usages\n\nWe believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited:\n\n* Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support.\n* Not disabling HTTP redirects.\n* Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin.\n\n## Remediation\n\n* Using the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`.\n* Disabling HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests.\n* Not using the `Proxy-Authorization` header.",

XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, `/`, `>`, or `=`, as each would then be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an application accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders these in pages that other users see as well, an attacker could use this to inject other attributes and perform XSS. The fix for the previous GHSA-h5c8-rqwp-cp95 CVE-2024-22195 only addressed spaces but not other characters.\n\nAccepting keys as user input is now explicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter, and code that does so without otherwise validating the input should be flagged as insecure, regardless of Jinja version. Accepting _values_ as user input continues to be safe.",

              "description": "### Impact\nA specially crafted argument to the `idna.encode()` function could consume significant resources. This may lead to a denial-of-service.\n\n### Patches\nThe function has been refined to reject such strings without the associated resource consumption in version 3.7.\n\n### Workarounds\nDomain names cannot exceed 253 characters in length, if this length limit is enforced prior to passing the domain to the `idna.encode()` function it should no longer consume significant resources. This is triggered by arbitrarily large inputs that would not occur in normal usage, but may be passed to the library assuming there is no preliminary input validation by the higher-level application.\n\n### References\n* https://huntr.com/bounties/93d78d07-d791-4b39-a845-cbfabc44aadb",

              "help": "# Incomplete string escaping or encoding\nSanitizing untrusted input is a common technique for preventing injection attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. Usually, this is done by escaping meta-characters such as quotes in a domain-specific way so that they are treated as normal characters.\n\nHowever, directly using the string `replace` method to perform escaping is notoriously error-prone. Common mistakes include only replacing the first occurrence of a meta-character, or backslash-escaping various meta-characters but not the backslash itself.\n\nIn the former case, later meta-characters are left undisturbed and can be used to subvert the sanitization. In the latter case, preceding a meta-character with a backslash leads to the backslash being escaped, but the meta-character appearing un-escaped, which again makes the sanitization ineffective.\n\nEven if the escaped string is not used in a security-critical context, incomplete escaping may still have undesirable effects, such as badly rendered or confusing output.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a (well-tested) sanitization library if at all possible. These libraries are much more likely to handle corner cases correctly than a custom implementation.\n\nAn even safer alternative is to design the application so that sanitization is not needed, for instance by using prepared statements for SQL queries.\n\nOtherwise, make sure to use a regular expression with the `g` flag to ensure that all occurrences are replaced, and remember to escape backslashes if applicable.\n\n\n## Example\nFor example, assume that we want to embed a user-controlled string `accountNumber` into a SQL query as part of a string literal. To avoid SQL injection, we need to ensure that the string does not contain un-escaped single-quote characters. The following function attempts to ensure this by doubling single quotes, and thereby escaping them:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction escapeQuotes(s) {\n  return s.replace(\"'\", \"''\");\n}\n\n```\nAs written, this sanitizer is ineffective: if the first argument to `replace` is a string literal (as in this case), only the *first* occurrence of that string is replaced.\n\nAs mentioned above, the function `escapeQuotes` should be replaced with a purpose-built sanitization library, such as the npm module `sqlstring`. Many other sanitization libraries are available from npm and other sources.\n\nIf this is not an option, `escapeQuotes` should be rewritten to use a regular expression with the `g` (\"global\") flag instead:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction escapeQuotes(s) {\n  return s.replace(/'/g, \"''\");\n}\n\n```\nNote that it is very important to include the global flag: `s.replace(/'/, \"''\")` *without* the global flag is equivalent to the first example above and only replaces the first quote.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP Top 10: [A1 Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection).\n* npm: [sqlstring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlstring) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-80](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n",

              "help": "# Incomplete string escaping or encoding\nSanitizing untrusted input is a common technique for preventing injection attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. Usually, this is done by escaping meta-characters such as quotes in a domain-specific way so that they are treated as normal characters.\n\nHowever, directly using the string `replace` method to perform escaping is notoriously error-prone. Common mistakes include only replacing the first occurrence of a meta-character, or backslash-escaping various meta-characters but not the backslash itself.\n\nIn the former case, later meta-characters are left undisturbed and can be used to subvert the sanitization. In the latter case, preceding a meta-character with a backslash leads to the backslash being escaped, but the meta-character appearing un-escaped, which again makes the sanitization ineffective.\n\nEven if the escaped string is not used in a security-critical context, incomplete escaping may still have undesirable effects, such as badly rendered or confusing output.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a (well-tested) sanitization library if at all possible. These libraries are much more likely to handle corner cases correctly than a custom implementation.\n\nAn even safer alternative is to design the application so that sanitization is not needed, for instance by using prepared statements for SQL queries.\n\nOtherwise, make sure to use a regular expression with the `g` flag to ensure that all occurrences are replaced, and remember to escape backslashes if applicable.\n\n\n## Example\nFor example, assume that we want to embed a user-controlled string `accountNumber` into a SQL query as part of a string literal. To avoid SQL injection, we need to ensure that the string does not contain un-escaped single-quote characters. The following function attempts to ensure this by doubling single quotes, and thereby escaping them:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction escapeQuotes(s) {\n  return s.replace(\"'\", \"''\");\n}\n\n```\nAs written, this sanitizer is ineffective: if the first argument to `replace` is a string literal (as in this case), only the *first* occurrence of that string is replaced.\n\nAs mentioned above, the function `escapeQuotes` should be replaced with a purpose-built sanitization library, such as the npm module `sqlstring`. Many other sanitization libraries are available from npm and other sources.\n\nIf this is not an option, `escapeQuotes` should be rewritten to use a regular expression with the `g` (\"global\") flag instead:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction escapeQuotes(s) {\n  return s.replace(/'/g, \"''\");\n}\n\n```\nNote that it is very important to include the global flag: `s.replace(/'/, \"''\")` *without* the global flag is equivalent to the first example above and only replaces the first quote.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP Top 10: [A1 Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection).\n* npm: [sqlstring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlstring) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-80](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n",

Clients, however, do not know the implementation details of the plugin, so it is important to document the capabilities of each option. The documentation for the plugin options that the client is responsible for sanitizing is of particular importance. Otherwise, the plugin may write user input (for example, a URL query parameter) to a web page without properly sanitizing it first, which allows for a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the client application through dynamic HTML construction.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nDocument all options that can lead to cross-site scripting attacks, and guard against unsafe inputs where dynamic HTML construction is not intended.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a jQuery plugin that selects a DOM element, and copies its text content to another DOM element. The selection is performed by using the plugin option `sourceSelector` as a CSS selector.\n\n\n```javascript\njQuery.fn.copyText = function(options) {\n\t// BAD may evaluate `options.sourceSelector` as HTML\n\tvar source = jQuery(options.sourceSelector),\n\t    text = source.text();\n\tjQuery(this).text(text);\n}\n\n```\nThis is, however, not a safe plugin, since the call to `jQuery` interprets `sourceSelector` as HTML if it is a string that starts with `<`.\n\nInstead of documenting that the client is responsible for sanitizing `sourceSelector`, the plugin can use `jQuery.find` to always interpret `sourceSelector` as a CSS selector:\n\n\n```javascript\njQuery.fn.copyText = function(options) {\n\t// GOOD may not evaluate `options.sourceSelector` as HTML\n\tvar source = jQuery.find(options.sourceSelector),\n\t    text = source.text();\n\tjQuery(this).text(text);\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet).\n* OWASP: [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP [DOM Based XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/DOM_Based_XSS).\n* OWASP [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).\n* Wikipedia: [Cross-site scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).\n* jQuery: [Plugin creation](https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/).\n* Bootstrap: [XSS vulnerable bootstrap plugins](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/27047).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n",

Using text from the DOM as HTML effectively unescapes the text, and thereby invalidates any escaping done on the text. If an attacker is able to control the safe sanitized text, then this vulnerability can be exploited to perform a cross-site scripting attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing text to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the References section below.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a webpage using a `data-target` attribute to select and manipulate a DOM element using the JQuery library. In the example, the `data-target` attribute is read into the `target` variable, and the `$` function is then supposed to use the `target` variable as a CSS selector to determine which element should be manipulated.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n    $(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\nHowever, if an attacker can control the `data-target` attribute, then the value of `target` can be used to cause the `$` function to execute arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nThe above vulnerability can be fixed by using `$.find` instead of `$`. The `$.find` function will only interpret `target` as a CSS selector and never as HTML, thereby preventing an XSS attack.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(\"button\").click(function () {\n    var target = $(this).attr(\"data-target\");\n\t$.find(target).hide();\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP: [XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* OWASP [DOM Based XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS).\n* OWASP [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).\n* Wikipedia: [Cross-site scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n",

This is particularly important for cookies, which are stored on the machine of the end-user.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that sensitive information is always encrypted before being stored. If possible, avoid placing sensitive information in cookies altogether. Instead, prefer storing, in the cookie, a key that can be used to look up the sensitive information.\n\nIn general, decrypt sensitive information only at the point where it is necessary for it to be used in cleartext.\n\nBe aware that external processes often store the `standard out` and `standard error` streams of the application, causing logged sensitive information to be stored as well.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example code stores user credentials (in this case, their password) in a cookie in plain text:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express();\napp.get('/remember-password', function (req, res) {\n  let pw = req.param(\"current_password\");\n  // BAD: Setting a cookie value with cleartext sensitive data.\n  res.cookie(\"password\", pw);\n});\n\n```\nInstead, the credentials should be encrypted, for instance by using the Node.js `crypto` module:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar crypto = require('crypto'),\n    password = getPassword();\n\nfunction encrypt(text){\n  var cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes-256-ctr', password);\n  return cipher.update(text, 'utf8', 'hex') + cipher.final('hex');\n}\n\nvar app = express();\napp.get('/remember-password', function (req, res) {\n  let pw = req.param(\"current_password\");\n  // GOOD: Encoding the value before setting it.\n  res.cookie(\"password\", encrypt(pw));\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* M.

              "help": "# Implicit narrowing conversion in compound assignment\nCompound assignment statements of the form `x += y` or `x *= y` perform an implicit narrowing conversion if the type of `x` is narrower than the type of `y`. For example, `x += y` is equivalent to `x = (T)(x + y)`, where `T` is the type of `x`. This can result in information loss and numeric errors such as overflows.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that the type of the left-hand side of the compound assignment statement is at least as wide as the type of the right-hand side.\n\n\n## Example\nIf `x` is of type `short` and `y` is of type `int`, the expression `x + y` is of type `int`. However, the expression `x += y` is equivalent to `x = (short) (x + y)`. The expression `x + y` is cast to the type of the left-hand side of the assignment: `short`, possibly leading to information loss.\n\nTo avoid implicitly narrowing the type of `x + y`, change the type of `x` to `int`. Then the types of `x` and `x + y` are both `int` and there is no need for an implicit cast.\n\n\n## References\n* J. Bloch and N. Gafter, *Java Puzzlers: Traps, Pitfalls, and Corner Cases*, Puzzle 9.

              "help": "# Query built from user-controlled sources\nIf a database query is built using string concatenation, and the components of the concatenation include user input, a user is likely to be able to run malicious database queries. This applies to various database query languages, including SQL and the Java Persistence Query Language.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUsually, it is better to use a SQL prepared statement than to build a complete SQL query with string concatenation. A prepared statement can include a wildcard, written as a question mark (?), for each part of the SQL query that is expected to be filled in by a different value each time it is run. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each wildcard in the query.\n\nIn the Java Persistence Query Language, it is better to use queries with parameters than to build a complete query with string concatenation. A Java Persistence query can include a parameter placeholder for each part of the query that is expected to be filled in by a different value when run. A parameter placeholder may be indicated by a colon (:) followed by a parameter name, or by a question mark (?) followed by an integer position. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each parameter in the query, using the `setParameter` method. Specifying the query using the `@NamedQuery` annotation introduces an additional level of safety: the query must be a constant string literal, preventing construction by string concatenation, and the only way to fill in values for parts of the query is by setting positional parameters.\n\nIt is good practice to use prepared statements (in SQL) or query parameters (in the Java Persistence Query Language) for supplying parameter values to a query, whether or not any of the parameters are directly traceable to user input. Doing so avoids any need to worry about quoting and escaping.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, the code runs a simple SQL query in two different ways.\n\nThe first way involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. The environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for SQL injection attacks.\n\nThe second way, which shows good practice, involves building a query, `query2`, with a single string literal that includes a wildcard (`?`). The wildcard is then given a value by calling `setString`. This version is immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a prepared query\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=? ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query2);\n    statement.setString(1, category);\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery();\n}\n```\n\n## Example\nThe following code shows several different ways to run a Java Persistence query.\n\nThe first example involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. Just like the SQL example, the environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for Java Persistence query injection attacks.\n\nThe remaining examples demonstrate different methods for safely building a Java Persistence query with user-supplied values:\n\n1. `query2` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).\n1. `query3` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).\n1. `namedQuery1` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute is a string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).\n1. `namedQuery2` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).\nThe parameter is then given a value by calling `setParameter`. These versions are immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable or user-supplied value are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have Java Persistence Query Language special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE '\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY p.price\";\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named parameter and set its value\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE :category ORDER BY p.price\"\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query2);\n    q.setParameter(\"category\", category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a positional parameter and set its value\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query3 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE ?1 ORDER BY p.price\"\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query3);\n    q.setParameter(1, category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named query with a named parameter and set its value\n    @NamedQuery(\n            name=\"lookupByCategory\",\n            query=\"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE :category ORDER BY p.price\")\n    private static class NQ {}\n    ...\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Query namedQuery1 = entityManager.createNamedQuery(\"lookupByCategory\");\n    namedQuery1.setParameter(\"category\", category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named query with a positional parameter and set its value\n    @NamedQuery(\n            name=\"lookupByCategory\",\n            query=\"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE ?1 ORDER BY p.price\")\n    private static class NQ {}\n    ...\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Query namedQuery2 = entityManager.createNamedQuery(\"lookupByCategory\");\n    namedQuery2.setParameter(1, category);\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java: [IDS00-J.

              "help": "# Query built from user-controlled sources\nIf a database query is built using string concatenation, and the components of the concatenation include user input, a user is likely to be able to run malicious database queries. This applies to various database query languages, including SQL and the Java Persistence Query Language.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUsually, it is better to use a SQL prepared statement than to build a complete SQL query with string concatenation. A prepared statement can include a wildcard, written as a question mark (?), for each part of the SQL query that is expected to be filled in by a different value each time it is run. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each wildcard in the query.\n\nIn the Java Persistence Query Language, it is better to use queries with parameters than to build a complete query with string concatenation. A Java Persistence query can include a parameter placeholder for each part of the query that is expected to be filled in by a different value when run. A parameter placeholder may be indicated by a colon (:) followed by a parameter name, or by a question mark (?) followed by an integer position. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each parameter in the query, using the `setParameter` method. Specifying the query using the `@NamedQuery` annotation introduces an additional level of safety: the query must be a constant string literal, preventing construction by string concatenation, and the only way to fill in values for parts of the query is by setting positional parameters.\n\nIt is good practice to use prepared statements (in SQL) or query parameters (in the Java Persistence Query Language) for supplying parameter values to a query, whether or not any of the parameters are directly traceable to user input. Doing so avoids any need to worry about quoting and escaping.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, the code runs a simple SQL query in two different ways.\n\nThe first way involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. The environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for SQL injection attacks.\n\nThe second way, which shows good practice, involves building a query, `query2`, with a single string literal that includes a wildcard (`?`). The wildcard is then given a value by calling `setString`. This version is immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a prepared query\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=? ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query2);\n    statement.setString(1, category);\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery();\n}\n```\n\n## Example\nThe following code shows several different ways to run a Java Persistence query.\n\nThe first example involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. Just like the SQL example, the environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for Java Persistence query injection attacks.\n\nThe remaining examples demonstrate different methods for safely building a Java Persistence query with user-supplied values:\n\n1. `query2` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).\n1. `query3` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).\n1. `namedQuery1` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute is a string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).\n1. `namedQuery2` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).\nThe parameter is then given a value by calling `setParameter`. These versions are immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable or user-supplied value are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have Java Persistence Query Language special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE '\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY p.price\";\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named parameter and set its value\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE :category ORDER BY p.price\"\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query2);\n    q.setParameter(\"category\", category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a positional parameter and set its value\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query3 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE ?1 ORDER BY p.price\"\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query3);\n    q.setParameter(1, category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named query with a named parameter and set its value\n    @NamedQuery(\n            name=\"lookupByCategory\",\n            query=\"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE :category ORDER BY p.price\")\n    private static class NQ {}\n    ...\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Query namedQuery1 = entityManager.createNamedQuery(\"lookupByCategory\");\n    namedQuery1.setParameter(\"category\", category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named query with a positional parameter and set its value\n    @NamedQuery(\n            name=\"lookupByCategory\",\n            query=\"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE ?1 ORDER BY p.price\")\n    private static class NQ {}\n    ...\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Query namedQuery2 = entityManager.createNamedQuery(\"lookupByCategory\");\n    namedQuery2.setParameter(1, category);\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java: [IDS00-J.

              "help": "# Polynomial regular expression used on uncontrolled data\nSome regular expressions take a long time to match certain input strings to the point where the time it takes to match a string of length *n* is proportional to *n<sup>k</sup>* or even *2<sup>n</sup>*. Such regular expressions can negatively affect performance, or even allow a malicious user to perform a Denial of Service (\"DoS\") attack by crafting an expensive input string for the regular expression to match.\n\nThe regular expression engines provided by many popular JavaScript platforms use backtracking non-deterministic finite automata to implement regular expression matching. While this approach is space-efficient and allows supporting advanced features like capture groups, it is not time-efficient in general. The worst-case time complexity of such an automaton can be polynomial or even exponential, meaning that for strings of a certain shape, increasing the input length by ten characters may make the automaton about 1000 times slower.\n\nTypically, a regular expression is affected by this problem if it contains a repetition of the form `r*` or `r+` where the sub-expression `r` is ambiguous in the sense that it can match some string in multiple ways. More information about the precise circumstances can be found in the references.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nModify the regular expression to remove the ambiguity, or ensure that the strings matched with the regular expression are short enough that the time-complexity does not matter.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider this use of a regular expression, which removes all leading and trailing whitespace in a string:\n\n```javascript\n\ntext.replace(/^\\s+|\\s+$/g, ''); // BAD\n```\nThe sub-expression `\"\\s+$\"` will match the whitespace characters in `text` from left to right, but it can start matching anywhere within a whitespace sequence. This is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a whitespace character. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each whitespace sequence once per whitespace character in the sequence.\n\nThis ultimately means that the time cost of trimming a string is quadratic in the length of the string. So a string like `\"a b\"` will take milliseconds to process, but a similar string with a million spaces instead of just one will take several minutes.\n\nAvoid this problem by rewriting the regular expression to not contain the ambiguity about when to start matching whitespace sequences. For instance, by using a negative look-behind (`/^\\s+|(?<!\\s)\\s+$/g`), or just by using the built-in trim method (`text.trim()`).\n\nNote that the sub-expression `\"^\\s+\"` is **not** problematic as the `^` anchor restricts when that sub-expression can start matching, and as the regular expression engine matches from left to right.\n\n\n## Example\nAs a similar, but slightly subtler problem, consider the regular expression that matches lines with numbers, possibly written using scientific notation:\n\n```javascript\n\n/^0\\.\\d+E?\\d+$/.test(str) // BAD\n```\nThe problem with this regular expression is in the sub-expression `\\d+E?\\d+` because the second `\\d+` can start matching digits anywhere after the first match of the first `\\d+` if there is no `E` in the input string.\n\nThis is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a digit. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each digit sequence once per digit in the sequence, again leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\nTo make the processing faster, the regular expression should be rewritten such that the two `\\d+` sub-expressions do not have overlapping matches: `^0\\.\\d+(E\\d+)?$`.\n\n\n## Example\nSometimes it is unclear how a regular expression can be rewritten to avoid the problem. In such cases, it often suffices to limit the length of the input string. For instance, the following regular expression is used to match numbers, and on some non-number inputs it can have quadratic time complexity:\n\n```javascript\n\n/^(\\+|-)?(\\d+|(\\d*\\.\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\d+)?$/.test(str) // BAD\n```\nIt is not immediately obvious how to rewrite this regular expression to avoid the problem. However, you can mitigate performance issues by limiting the length to 1000 characters, which will always finish in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n```javascript\n\nif (str.length > 1000) {\n    throw new Error(\"Input too long\");\n}\n\n/^(\\+|-)?(\\d+|(\\d*\\.\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\d+)?$/.test(str)\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).\n* James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: [Static Analysis for Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0849).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n",

              "help": "# Information exposure through a stack trace\nSoftware developers often add stack traces to error messages, as a debugging aid. Whenever that error message occurs for an end user, the developer can use the stack trace to help identify how to fix the problem. In particular, stack traces can tell the developer more about the sequence of events that led to a failure, as opposed to merely the final state of the software when the error occurred.\n\nUnfortunately, the same information can be useful to an attacker. The sequence of function names in a stack trace can reveal the structure of the application as well as any internal components it relies on.

              "help": "# Inclusion of functionality from an untrusted source\nIncluding a resource from an untrusted source or using an untrusted channel may allow an attacker to include arbitrary code in the response. When including an external resource (for example, a `script` element or an `iframe` element) on a page, it is important to ensure that the received data is not malicious.\n\nWhen including external resources, it is possible to verify that the responding server is the intended one by using an `https` URL. This prevents a MITM (man-in-the-middle) attack where an attacker might have been able to spoof a server response.\n\nEven when `https` is used, an attacker might still compromise the server. When you use a `script` element, you can check for subresource integrity - that is, you can check the contents of the data received by supplying a cryptographic digest of the expected sources to the `script` element. The script will only load sources that match the digest and an attacker will be unable to modify the script even when the server is compromised.\n\nSubresource integrity (SRI) checking is commonly recommended when importing a fixed version of a library - for example, from a CDN (content-delivery network). Then, the fixed digest of that version of the library can easily be added to the `script` element's `integrity` attribute.\n\nA dynamic service cannot be easily used with SRI. Nevertheless, it is possible to list multiple acceptable SHA hashes in the `integrity` attribute, such as those for the content generated for major browers used by your users.\n\nSee the \\[\\`CUSTOMIZING.md\\`\\](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/javascript/ql/src/Security/CWE-830/CUSTOMIZING.md) file in the source code for this query for information on how to extend the list of hostnames required to use SRI by this query.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nWhen an `iframe` element is used to embed a page, it is important to use an `https` URL.\n\nWhen using a `script` element to load a script, it is important to use an `https` URL and to consider checking subresource integrity.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example loads the jQuery library from the jQuery CDN without using `https` and without checking subresource integrity.\n\n\n```html\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <title>jQuery demo</title>\n        <script src=\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.slim.min.js\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        ...\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\nInstead, loading jQuery from the same domain using `https` and checking subresource integrity is recommended, as in the next example.\n\n\n```html\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <title>jQuery demo</title>\n        <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.slim.min.js\" integrity=\"sha256-u7e5khyithlIdTpu22PHhENmPcRdFiHRjhAuHcs05RI=\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        ...\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## References\n* MDN: [Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity)\n* Smashing Magazine: [Understanding Subresource Integrity](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/understanding-subresource-integrity/)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-830](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/830.html).\n",

              "help": "# Inclusion of functionality from an untrusted source\nIncluding a resource from an untrusted source or using an untrusted channel may allow an attacker to include arbitrary code in the response. When including an external resource (for example, a `script` element or an `iframe` element) on a page, it is important to ensure that the received data is not malicious.\n\nWhen including external resources, it is possible to verify that the responding server is the intended one by using an `https` URL. This prevents a MITM (man-in-the-middle) attack where an attacker might have been able to spoof a server response.\n\nEven when `https` is used, an attacker might still compromise the server. When you use a `script` element, you can check for subresource integrity - that is, you can check the contents of the data received by supplying a cryptographic digest of the expected sources to the `script` element. The script will only load sources that match the digest and an attacker will be unable to modify the script even when the server is compromised.\n\nSubresource integrity (SRI) checking is commonly recommended when importing a fixed version of a library - for example, from a CDN (content-delivery network). Then, the fixed digest of that version of the library can easily be added to the `script` element's `integrity` attribute.\n\nA dynamic service cannot be easily used with SRI. Nevertheless, it is possible to list multiple acceptable SHA hashes in the `integrity` attribute, such as those for the content generated for major browers used by your users.\n\nSee the \\[\\`CUSTOMIZING.md\\`\\](https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/main/javascript/ql/src/Security/CWE-830/CUSTOMIZING.md) file in the source code for this query for information on how to extend the list of hostnames required to use SRI by this query.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nWhen an `iframe` element is used to embed a page, it is important to use an `https` URL.\n\nWhen using a `script` element to load a script, it is important to use an `https` URL and to consider checking subresource integrity.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example loads the jQuery library from the jQuery CDN without using `https` and without checking subresource integrity.\n\n\n```html\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <title>jQuery demo</title>\n        <script src=\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.slim.min.js\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        ...\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\nInstead, loading jQuery from the same domain using `https` and checking subresource integrity is recommended, as in the next example.\n\n\n```html\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <title>jQuery demo</title>\n        <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.slim.min.js\" integrity=\"sha256-u7e5khyithlIdTpu22PHhENmPcRdFiHRjhAuHcs05RI=\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        ...\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## References\n* MDN: [Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity)\n* Smashing Magazine: [Understanding Subresource Integrity](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/understanding-subresource-integrity/)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-830](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/830.html).\n",

              "help": "# Server crash\nServers handle requests from clients until terminated deliberately by a server administrator. A client request that results in an uncaught server-side exception causes the current server response generation to fail, and should not have an effect on subsequent client requests.\n\nUnder some circumstances, uncaught exceptions can however cause the entire server to terminate abruptly. Such a behavior is highly undesirable, especially if it gives malicious users the ability to turn off the server at will, which is an efficient denial-of-service attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that the processing of client requests can not cause uncaught exceptions to terminate the entire server abruptly.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following server code checks if a client-provided file path is valid before saving data to that path. It would be reasonable to expect that the server responds with an error in case the request contains an invalid file path. However, the server instead throws an exception, which is uncaught in the context of the asynchronous callback invocation (`fs.access(...)`). This causes the entire server to terminate abruptly.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require(\"express\"),\n  fs = require(\"fs\");\n\nfunction save(rootDir, path, content) {\n  if (!isValidPath(rootDir, req.query.filePath)) {\n    throw new Error(`Invalid filePath: ${req.query.filePath}`); // BAD crashes the server\n  }\n  // write content to disk\n}\n\nexpress().post(\"/save\", (req, res) => {\n  fs.access(rootDir, (err) => {\n    if (err) {\n      console.error(\n        `Server setup is corrupted, ${rootDir} cannot be accessed!`\n      );\n      res.status(500);\n      res.end();\n      return;\n    }\n    save(rootDir, req.query.path, req.body);\n    res.status(200);\n    res.end();\n  });\n});\n\n```\nTo remedy this, the server can catch the exception explicitly with a `try/catch` block, and generate an appropriate error response instead:\n\n\n```javascript\n// ...\nexpress().post(\"/save\", (req, res) => {\n  fs.access(rootDir, (err) => {\n    // ...\n    try {\n      save(rootDir, req.query.path, req.body); // GOOD exception is caught below\n      res.status(200);\n      res.end();\n    } catch (e) {\n      res.status(500);\n      res.end();\n    }\n  });\n});\n\n```\nTo simplify exception handling, it may be advisable to switch to async/await syntax instead of using callbacks, which allows wrapping the entire request handler in a `try/catch` block:\n\n\n```javascript\n// ...\nexpress().post(\"/save\", async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    await fs.promises.access(rootDir);\n    save(rootDir, req.query.path, req.body); // GOOD exception is caught below\n    res.status(200);\n    res.end();\n  } catch (e) {\n    res.status(500);\n    res.end();\n  }\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-248](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/248.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n",

Specifically, a state-changing request should include a secret token so the request can't be forged by an attacker. Otherwise, unwanted requests can be submitted on behalf of a user who visits a malicious website.\n\nThis is typically mitigated by embedding a session-specific secret token in each request. This token is then checked as an additional authentication measure. A malicious website should have no way of guessing the correct token to embed in the request.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a middleware package such as `lusca.csrf` to protect against CSRF attacks.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the example below, the server authenticates users before performing the `changeEmail` POST action:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n  cookieParser = require(\"cookie-parser\"),\n  bodyParser = require(\"body-parser\"),\n  session = require(\"express-session\");\n\napp.use(cookieParser());\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\napp.use(session({ secret: process.env['SECRET'], cookie: { maxAge: 60000 } }));\n\n// ...\n\napp.post(\"/changeEmail\", function(req, res) {\n  const userId = req.session.id;\n  const email = req.body[\"email\"];\n  // ... update email associated with userId\n});\n\n```\nThis is not secure. An attacker can submit a POST `changeEmail` request on behalf of a user who visited a malicious website. Since authentication happens without any action from the user, the `changeEmail` action would be executed, despite not being initiated by the user.\n\nThis vulnerability can be mitigated by installing a CSRF protecting middleware handler:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n  cookieParser = require(\"cookie-parser\"),\n  bodyParser = require(\"body-parser\"),\n  session = require(\"express-session\"),\n  csrf = require('lusca').csrf;\n\napp.use(cookieParser());\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\napp.use(session({ secret: process.env['SECRET'], cookie: { maxAge: 60000 } }));\napp.use(csrf());\n\n// ...\n\napp.post(\"/changeEmail\", function(req, res) {\n  const userId = req.session.id;\n  const email = req.body[\"email\"];\n  // ... update email associated with userId\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF))\n* NPM: [lusca](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lusca)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-352](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html).\n",

              "help": "# Prototype-polluting assignment\nMost JavaScript objects inherit the properties of the built-in `Object.prototype` object. Prototype pollution is a type of vulnerability in which an attacker is able to modify `Object.prototype`. Since most objects inherit from the compromised `Object.prototype` object, the attacker can use this to tamper with the application logic, and often escalate to remote code execution or cross-site scripting.\n\nOne way to cause prototype pollution is by modifying an object obtained via a user-controlled property name. Most objects have a special `__proto__` property that refers to `Object.prototype`. An attacker can abuse this special property to trick the application into performing unintended modifications of `Object.prototype`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse an associative data structure that is resilient to untrusted key values, such as a [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map). In some cases, a prototype-less object created with [Object.create(null)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create) may be preferable.\n\nAlternatively, restrict the computed property name so it can't clash with a built-in property, either by prefixing it with a constant string, or by rejecting inputs that don't conform to the expected format.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the example below, the untrusted value `req.params.id` is used as the property name `req.session.todos[id]`. If a malicious user passes in the ID value `__proto__`, the variable `items` will then refer to `Object.prototype`. Finally, the modification of `items` then allows the attacker to inject arbitrary properties onto `Object.prototype`.\n\n\n```javascript\nlet express = require('express');\nlet app = express()\n\napp.put('/todos/:id', (req, res) => {\n    let id = req.params.id;\n    let items = req.session.todos[id];\n    if (!items) {\n        items = req.session.todos[id] = {};\n    }\n    items[req.query.name] = req.query.text;\n    res.end(200);\n});\n\n```\nOne way to fix this is to use [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) objects to associate key/value pairs instead of regular objects, as shown below:\n\n\n```javascript\nlet express = require('express');\nlet app = express()\n\napp.put('/todos/:id', (req, res) => {\n    let id = req.params.id;\n    let items = req.session.todos.get(id);\n    if (!items) {\n        items = new Map();\n        req.sessions.todos.set(id, items);\n    }\n    items.set(req.query.name, req.query.text);\n    res.end(200);\n});\n\n```\nAnother way to fix it is to prevent the `__proto__` property from being used as a key, as shown below:\n\n\n```javascript\nlet express = require('express');\nlet app = express()\n\napp.put('/todos/:id', (req, res) => {\n    let id = req.params.id;\n    if (id === '__proto__' || id === 'constructor' || id === 'prototype') {\n        res.end(403);\n        return;\n    }\n    let items = req.session.todos[id];\n    if (!items) {\n        items = req.session.todos[id] = {};\n    }\n    items[req.query.name] = req.query.text;\n    res.end(200);\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* MDN: [Object.prototype.__proto__](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto)\n* MDN: [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-471](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/471.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-915](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/915.html).\n",

              "help": "# Type confusion through parameter tampering\nSanitizing untrusted HTTP request parameters is a common technique for preventing injection attacks such as SQL injection or path traversal. This is sometimes done by checking if the request parameters contain blacklisted substrings.\n\nHowever, sanitizing request parameters assuming they have type `String` and using the builtin string methods such as `String.prototype.indexOf` is susceptible to type confusion attacks. In a type confusion attack, an attacker tampers with an HTTP request parameter such that it has a value of type `Array` instead of the expected type `String`. Furthermore, the content of the array has been crafted to bypass sanitizers by exploiting that some identically named methods of strings and arrays behave differently.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nCheck the runtime type of sanitizer inputs if the input type is user-controlled.\n\nAn even safer alternative is to design the application so that sanitization is not needed, for instance by using prepared statements for SQL queries.\n\n\n## Example\nFor example, Node.js server frameworks usually present request parameters as strings. But if an attacker sends multiple request parameters with the same name, then the request parameter is represented as an array instead.\n\nIn the following example, a sanitizer checks that a path does not contain the `\"..\"` string, which would allow an attacker to access content outside a user-accessible directory.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar app = require(\"express\")(),\n  path = require(\"path\");\n\napp.get(\"/user-files\", function(req, res) {\n  var file = req.param(\"file\");\n  if (file.indexOf(\"..\") !== -1) {\n    // BAD\n    // we forbid relative paths that contain ..\n    // as these could leave the public directory\n    res.status(400).send(\"Bad request\");\n  } else {\n    var absolute = path.resolve(\"/public/\" + file);\n    console.log(\"Sending file: %s\", absolute);\n    res.sendFile(absolute);\n  }\n});\n\n```\nAs written, this sanitizer is ineffective: an array like `[\"../\", \"/../secret.txt\"]` will bypass the sanitizer. The array does not contain `\"..\"` as an element, so the call to `indexOf` returns `-1` . This is problematic since the value of the `absolute` variable then ends up being `\"/secret.txt\"`. This happens since the concatenation of `\"/public/\"` and the array results in `\"/public/../,/../secret.txt\"`, which the `resolve`-call converts to `\"/secret.txt\"`.\n\nTo fix the sanitizer, check that the request parameter is a string, and not an array:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar app = require(\"express\")(),\n  path = require(\"path\");\n\napp.get(\"/user-files\", function(req, res) {\n  var file = req.param(\"file\");\n  if (typeof file !== 'string' || file.indexOf(\"..\") !== -1) {\n    // GOOD\n    // we forbid relative paths that contain ..\n    // as these could leave the public directory\n    res.status(400).send(\"Bad request\");\n  } else {\n    var absolute = path.resolve(\"/public/\" + file);\n    console.log(\"Sending file: %s\", absolute);\n    res.sendFile(absolute);\n  }\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Node.js API: [querystring](https://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-843](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/843.html).\n",

This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nValidate user input before using it to construct a file path.\n\nThe validation method you should use depends on whether you want to allow the user to specify complex paths with multiple components that may span multiple folders, or only simple filenames without a path component.\n\nIn the former case, a common strategy is to make sure that the constructed file path is contained within a safe root folder. First, normalize the path using `path.resolve` or `fs.realpathSync` to remove any \"..\" segments. You should always normalize the file path since an unnormalized path that starts with the root folder can still be used to access files outside the root folder. Then, after you have normalized the path, check that the path starts with the root folder.\n\nIn the latter case, you can use a library like the `sanitize-filename` npm package to eliminate any special characters from the file path. Note that it is *not* sufficient to only remove \"../\" sequences: for example, applying this filter to \".../...//\" would still result in the string \"../\".\n\nFinally, the simplest (but most restrictive) option is to use an allow list of safe patterns and make sure that the user input matches one of these patterns.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the first (bad) example, the code reads the file name from an HTTP request, then accesses that file within a root folder. A malicious user could enter a file name containing \"../\" segments to navigate outside the root folder and access sensitive files.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs'),\n      http = require('http'),\n      url = require('url');\n\nconst ROOT = \"/var/www/\";\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  let filePath = url.parse(req.url, true).query.path;\n\n  // BAD: This function uses unsanitized input that can read any file on the file system.\n  res.write(fs.readFileSync(ROOT + filePath, 'utf8'));\n});\n```\nThe second (good) example shows how to avoid access to sensitive files by sanitizing the file path. First, the code resolves the file name relative to a root folder, normalizing the path and removing any \"../\" segments in the process. Then, the code calls `fs.realpathSync` to resolve any symbolic links in the path. Finally, the code checks that the normalized path starts with the path of the root folder, ensuring the file is contained within the root folder.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs'),\n      http = require('http'),\n      path = require('path'),\n      url = require('url');\n\nconst ROOT = \"/var/www/\";\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  let filePath = url.parse(req.url, true).query.path;\n\n  // GOOD: Verify that the file path is under the root directory\n  filePath = fs.realpathSync(path.resolve(ROOT, filePath));\n  if (!filePath.startsWith(ROOT)) {\n    res.statusCode = 403;\n    res.end();\n    return;\n  }\n  res.write(fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8'));\n});\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal).\n* npm: [sanitize-filename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-filename) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-36](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-73](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-99](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/99.html).\n",

This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nValidate user input before using it to construct a file path.\n\nThe validation method you should use depends on whether you want to allow the user to specify complex paths with multiple components that may span multiple folders, or only simple filenames without a path component.\n\nIn the former case, a common strategy is to make sure that the constructed file path is contained within a safe root folder. First, normalize the path using `path.resolve` or `fs.realpathSync` to remove any \"..\" segments. You should always normalize the file path since an unnormalized path that starts with the root folder can still be used to access files outside the root folder. Then, after you have normalized the path, check that the path starts with the root folder.\n\nIn the latter case, you can use a library like the `sanitize-filename` npm package to eliminate any special characters from the file path. Note that it is *not* sufficient to only remove \"../\" sequences: for example, applying this filter to \".../...//\" would still result in the string \"../\".\n\nFinally, the simplest (but most restrictive) option is to use an allow list of safe patterns and make sure that the user input matches one of these patterns.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the first (bad) example, the code reads the file name from an HTTP request, then accesses that file within a root folder. A malicious user could enter a file name containing \"../\" segments to navigate outside the root folder and access sensitive files.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs'),\n      http = require('http'),\n      url = require('url');\n\nconst ROOT = \"/var/www/\";\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  let filePath = url.parse(req.url, true).query.path;\n\n  // BAD: This function uses unsanitized input that can read any file on the file system.\n  res.write(fs.readFileSync(ROOT + filePath, 'utf8'));\n});\n```\nThe second (good) example shows how to avoid access to sensitive files by sanitizing the file path. First, the code resolves the file name relative to a root folder, normalizing the path and removing any \"../\" segments in the process. Then, the code calls `fs.realpathSync` to resolve any symbolic links in the path. Finally, the code checks that the normalized path starts with the path of the root folder, ensuring the file is contained within the root folder.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs'),\n      http = require('http'),\n      path = require('path'),\n      url = require('url');\n\nconst ROOT = \"/var/www/\";\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  let filePath = url.parse(req.url, true).query.path;\n\n  // GOOD: Verify that the file path is under the root directory\n  filePath = fs.realpathSync(path.resolve(ROOT, filePath));\n  if (!filePath.startsWith(ROOT)) {\n    res.statusCode = 403;\n    res.end();\n    return;\n  }\n  res.write(fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8'));\n});\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal).\n* npm: [sanitize-filename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-filename) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-36](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-73](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-99](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/99.html).\n",

A malicious user could enter a file name containing \"../\" segments to navigate outside the root folder and access sensitive files.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs'),\n      http = require('http'),\n      url = require('url');\n\nconst ROOT = \"/var/www/\";\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  let filePath = url.parse(req.url, true).query.path;\n\n  // BAD: This function uses unsanitized input that can read any file on the file system.\n  res.write(fs.readFileSync(ROOT + filePath, 'utf8'));\n});\n```\nThe second (good) example shows how to avoid access to sensitive files by sanitizing the file path. First, the code resolves the file name relative to a root folder, normalizing the path and removing any \"../\" segments in the process. Then, the code calls `fs.realpathSync` to resolve any symbolic links in the path. Finally, the code checks that the normalized path starts with the path of the root folder, ensuring the file is contained within the root folder.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs'),\n      http = require('http'),\n      path = require('path'),\n      url = require('url');\n\nconst ROOT = \"/var/www/\";\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  let filePath = url.parse(req.url, true).query.path;\n\n  // GOOD: Verify that the file path is under the root directory\n  filePath = fs.realpathSync(path.resolve(ROOT, filePath));\n  if (!filePath.startsWith(ROOT)) {\n    res.statusCode = 403;\n    res.end();\n    return;\n  }\n  res.write(fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8'));\n});\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal).\n* npm: [sanitize-filename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-filename) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-36](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-73](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-99](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/99.html).\n",

This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nValidate user input before using it to construct a file path.\n\nThe validation method you should use depends on whether you want to allow the user to specify complex paths with multiple components that may span multiple folders, or only simple filenames without a path component.\n\nIn the former case, a common strategy is to make sure that the constructed file path is contained within a safe root folder. First, normalize the path using `path.resolve` or `fs.realpathSync` to remove any \"..\" segments. You should always normalize the file path since an unnormalized path that starts with the root folder can still be used to access files outside the root folder. Then, after you have normalized the path, check that the path starts with the root folder.\n\nIn the latter case, you can use a library like the `sanitize-filename` npm package to eliminate any special characters from the file path. Note that it is *not* sufficient to only remove \"../\" sequences: for example, applying this filter to \".../...//\" would still result in the string \"../\".\n\nFinally, the simplest (but most restrictive) option is to use an allow list of safe patterns and make sure that the user input matches one of these patterns.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the first (bad) example, the code reads the file name from an HTTP request, then accesses that file within a root folder. A malicious user could enter a file name containing \"../\" segments to navigate outside the root folder and access sensitive files.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs'),\n      http = require('http'),\n      url = require('url');\n\nconst ROOT = \"/var/www/\";\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  let filePath = url.parse(req.url, true).query.path;\n\n  // BAD: This function uses unsanitized input that can read any file on the file system.\n  res.write(fs.readFileSync(ROOT + filePath, 'utf8'));\n});\n```\nThe second (good) example shows how to avoid access to sensitive files by sanitizing the file path. First, the code resolves the file name relative to a root folder, normalizing the path and removing any \"../\" segments in the process. Then, the code calls `fs.realpathSync` to resolve any symbolic links in the path. Finally, the code checks that the normalized path starts with the path of the root folder, ensuring the file is contained within the root folder.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs'),\n      http = require('http'),\n      path = require('path'),\n      url = require('url');\n\nconst ROOT = \"/var/www/\";\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  let filePath = url.parse(req.url, true).query.path;\n\n  // GOOD: Verify that the file path is under the root directory\n  filePath = fs.realpathSync(path.resolve(ROOT, filePath));\n  if (!filePath.startsWith(ROOT)) {\n    res.statusCode = 403;\n    res.end();\n    return;\n  }\n  res.write(fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8'));\n});\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal).\n* npm: [sanitize-filename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-filename) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-36](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-73](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-99](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/99.html).\n",

These entries include a file path for the entry, but these file paths are not restricted and may contain unexpected special elements such as the directory traversal element (`..`).

This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\n\nFor example, if a zip file contains a file entry `..\\sneaky-file`, and the zip file is extracted to the directory `c:\\output`, then naively combining the paths would result in an output file path of `c:\\output\\..\\sneaky-file`, which would cause the file to be written to `c:\\sneaky-file`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that output paths constructed from zip archive entries are validated to prevent writing files to unexpected locations.\n\nThe recommended way of writing an output file from a zip archive entry is to check that `\"..\"` does not occur in the path.\n\n\n## Example\nIn this example an archive is extracted without validating file paths.

Alternatively, check that the untrusted data is a literal value and not a query object before using it in a query.\n\nFor SQL queries, use query parameters or prepared statements to embed untrusted data into the query string, or use a library like `sqlstring` to escape untrusted data.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, assume the function `handler` is an HTTP request handler in a web application, whose parameter `req` contains the request object.\n\nThe handler constructs an SQL query string from user input and executes it as a database query using the `pg` library. The user input may contain quote characters, so this code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n      pg = require(\"pg\"),\n      pool = new pg.Pool(config);\n\napp.get(\"search\", function handler(req, res) {\n  // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it\n  var query1 =\n    \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\" +\n    req.params.category +\n    \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n  pool.query(query1, [], function(err, results) {\n    // process results\n  });\n});\n\n```\nTo fix this vulnerability, we can use query parameters to embed the user input into the query string. In this example, we use the API offered by the `pg` Postgres database connector library, but other libraries offer similar features. This version is immune to injection attacks.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n      pg = require(\"pg\"),\n      pool = new pg.Pool(config);\n\napp.get(\"search\", function handler(req, res) {\n  // GOOD: use parameters\n  var query2 =\n    \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=$1 ORDER BY PRICE\";\n  pool.query(query2, [req.params.category], function(err, results) {\n    // process results\n  });\n});\n\n```\nAlternatively, we can use a library like `sqlstring` to escape the user input before embedding it into the query string:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n      pg = require(\"pg\"),\n      SqlString = require('sqlstring'),\n      pool = new pg.Pool(config);\n\napp.get(\"search\", function handler(req, res) {\n  // GOOD: the category is escaped using mysql.escape\n  var query1 =\n    \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\" +\n    SqlString.escape(req.params.category) +\n    \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n  pool.query(query1, [], function(err, results) {\n    // process results\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an express handler attempts to delete a single document from a MongoDB collection. The document to be deleted is identified by its `_id` field, which is constructed from user input. The user input may contain a query object, so this code is vulnerable to a NoSQL injection attack.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst mongoose = require(\"mongoose\");\nconst Todo = mongoose.model(\n  \"Todo\",\n  new mongoose.Schema({ text: { type: String } }, { timestamps: true })\n);\n\nconst app = express();\napp.use(express.json());\napp.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\n\napp.delete(\"/api/delete\", async (req, res) => {\n  let id = req.body.id;\n\n  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: id }); // BAD: id might be an object with special properties\n\n  res.json({ status: \"ok\" });\n});\n\n```\nTo fix this vulnerability, we can use the `$eq` operator to ensure that the user input is interpreted as a literal value and not as a query object:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.delete(\"/api/delete\", async (req, res) => {\n  let id = req.body.id;\n  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: { $eq: id } }); // GOOD: using $eq operator for the comparison\n\n  res.json({ status: \"ok\" });\n});\n```\nAlternatively check that the user input is a literal value and not a query object before using it:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.delete(\"/api/delete\", async (req, res) => {\n  let id = req.body.id;\n  if (typeof id !== \"string\") {\n    res.status(400).json({ status: \"error\" });\n    return;\n  }\n  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: id }); // GOOD: id is guaranteed to be a string\n\n  res.json({ status: \"ok\" });\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection).\n* MongoDB: [$eq operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/eq).\n* OWASP: [NoSQL injection](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/GOD16-NOSQL.pdf).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-90](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/90.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-943](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/943.html).\n",

In these attacks, unsuspecting users can be redirected to a malicious site that looks very similar to the real site they intend to visit, but which is controlled by the attacker.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo guard against untrusted URL redirection, it is advisable to avoid putting user input directly into a redirect URL. Instead, maintain a list of authorized redirects on the server; then choose from that list based on the user input provided.\n\nIf this is not possible, then the user input should be validated in some other way, for example, by verifying that the target URL is on the same host as the current page.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used directly in a URL redirect without validating the input, which facilitates phishing attacks:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\napp.get(\"/redirect\", function (req, res) {\n  // BAD: a request parameter is incorporated without validation into a URL redirect\n  res.redirect(req.query[\"target\"]);\n});\n\n```\nOne way to remedy the problem is to validate the user input against a known fixed string before doing the redirection:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\nconst VALID_REDIRECT = \"http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html\";\n\napp.get(\"/redirect\", function (req, res) {\n  // GOOD: the request parameter is validated against a known fixed string\n  let target = req.query[\"target\"];\n  if (VALID_REDIRECT === target) {\n    res.redirect(target);\n  } else {\n    res.redirect(\"/\");\n  }\n});\n\n```\nAlternatively, we can check that the target URL does not redirect to a different host by parsing it relative to a base URL with a known host and verifying that the host stays the same:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")();\n\nfunction isLocalUrl(path) {\n  try {\n    return (\n      // TODO: consider substituting your own domain for example.com\n      new URL(path, \"https://example.com\").origin === \"https://example.com\"\n    );\n  } catch (e) {\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n\napp.get(\"/redirect\", function (req, res) {\n  // GOOD: check that we don't redirect to a different host\n  let target = req.query[\"target\"];\n  if (isLocalUrl(target)) {\n    res.redirect(target);\n  } else {\n    res.redirect(\"/\");\n  }\n});\n\n```\nNote that as written, the above code will allow redirects to URLs on `example.com`, which is harmless but perhaps not intended. You can substitute your own domain (if known) for `example.com` to prevent this.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [ XSS Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-601](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html).\n",

              "description": "### Impact\n\nMulter <2.0.0 is vulnerable to a resource exhaustion and memory leak issue due to improper stream handling. When the HTTP request stream emits an error, the internal `busboy` stream is not closed, violating Node.js stream safety guidance.\n\nThis leads to unclosed streams accumulating over time, consuming memory and file descriptors. Under sustained or repeated failure conditions, this can result in denial of service, requiring manual server restarts to recover. All users of Multer handling file uploads are potentially impacted.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to `2.0.0`\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/expressjs/multer/pull/1120\n- https://github.com/expressjs/multer/commit/2c8505f207d923dd8de13a9f93a4563e59933665",

There is a possibility of using a different algorithm and key combination in verification  than the one that was used to sign the tokens. Specifically, tokens signed with an asymmetric public key could be verified with a symmetric HS256 algorithm. This can lead to successful validation of forged tokens. \n\n# Am I affected?\n\nYou will be affected if your application is supporting usage of both symmetric key and asymmetric key in jwt.verify() implementation with the same key retrieval function. \n\n# How do I fix it?\n \nUpdate to version 9.0.0.\n\n# Will the fix impact my users?\n\nThere is no impact for end users",

The following is an example of a proper configuration\n\n``` \nconst checkJwt = jwt({\n  secret: jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret({\n    rateLimit: true,\n    jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,\n    jwksUri: `https://${DOMAIN}/.well-known/jwks.json`\n  }),\n  // Validate the audience and the issuer.\n  audience: process.env.AUDIENCE,\n  issuer: `https://${DOMAIN}/`,\n  // restrict allowed algorithms\n  algorithms: ['RS256']\n}); \n```\n\n### Will this update impact my users?\nThe fix provided in patch will not affect your users if you specified the algorithms allowed. The patch now makes **algorithms** a required configuration. \n\n\n### Credit\nIST Group",
